# Affinidi for Visual Studio Code
*Build privacy-preserving apps in minutes*

## Getting Started

The digital world is changing, and customers today want greater control and ownership of their data. As a developer, you can meet these demands and create apps that empower your customers to better manage their privacy, data storage, and portability. In other words, customers who use apps can decide how and where their data will be used.   

Affinidi’s vision is to empower communities with control and ownership of their data, thereby creating new business models and greater trust. 

In line with this vision, Affinidi has developed an extension that provides access to Affinidi Developer Tools directly within Visual Studio Code. This extension is a one-stop place for all the tools you need to build privacy-preserving applications, without having to leave your IDE. 

## What is Affinidi VSCode Extension?

## FAQ

### A note from Affinidi 

Affinidi Developer Tools are currently in the open beta phase and we are refining our product every day. The Affinidi Developer Tools may be incomplete and may contain errors – they may be unstable and may cause a loss of functionality and data. Use of the Affinidi Developer Tools will be at your own risk. As our engineers seek to improve our platform, we would not have the resources to provide any maintenance or tech support at this time. Please bear with us as we continue to improve the platform. 

### What can I develop? 

You are only limited by your imagination! Affinidi Developer Tools is a toolbox with which you can build software applications for personal or commercial use. 

### Is there anything I should not develop? 

We only provide the tools - how you use them is largely up to you. We have no control over what you develop with our tools - but please use our tools responsibly! 

We hope that you would not develop anything that contravenes any applicable laws or regulations. Your projects should also not infringe on Affinidi’s or any third party’s intellectual property (for instance, misusing other parties’ data, code, logos, etc). 

### What responsibilities do I have to my end-users? 

Please ensure that you have in place your own terms and conditions, privacy policies, and other safeguards to ensure that the projects you build are secure for your end users. 

If you are processing personal data, please protect the privacy and other legal rights of your end-users and store their personal or sensitive information securely. 

Some of our components would also require you to incorporate our end-user notices into your terms and conditions. 

### Are Affinidi Developer Tools free for use? 

Affinidi Developer Tools are free during the open beta phase, so come onboard and experiment with our tools and see what you can build! We may bill for certain components in the future, but we will inform you beforehand. 

### Is there any limit or cap to my usage of the Affinidi Developer Tools? 

We may from time to time impose limits on your use of the Affinidi Developer Tools, such as limiting the number of API requests that you may make in a given duration. This is to ensure the smooth operation of the Affinidi Developer Tools so that you and all our other users can have a pleasant experience as we continue to scale and improve the Affinidi Developer Tools. 

### Do I need to provide you with anything? 

From time to time, we may request certain information from you to ensure that you are complying with the [Terms of Use](https://build.affinidi.com/dev-tools/terms-of-use.pdf). 

### Can I share my developer’s account with others? 

When you create a developer’s account with us, we will issue you your private login credentials. Please do not share this with anyone else, as you would be responsible for activities that happen under your account. If you have friends who are interested, ask them to sign up – let's build together!
