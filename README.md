# Affinidi for Visual Studio Code

## Context

Affinidi’s vision is to empower communities with control and ownership of their data, creating new business models and greater trust.

As the customer demand for control and ownership of data continues to increase, it is becoming increasingly important for developers to better manage data privacy and portability within their apps. With our tooling, you can start creating a privacy-preserving app within minutes.

## What are privacy-preserving apps? 

Privacy-preserving apps make it easy to manage and store customer information while giving your customers more control over how this information is used and shared. We enable this data ownership and control through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). 

Learn more about [VCs](https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9), [trust triangle](https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321), [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd), and [selective disclosure](https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602).

## What is Affinidi’s VSCode Extension

Affinidi’s VSCode Plugin provides access to Affinidi’s dev tools directly within the Visual Studio Code editor’s command palette. With this VS extension, you can sign in, create a new project, get an API Key, manage your keys, and more.  

This plugin is a one-stop place for all the dev tools you need to build privacy-preserving applications, without having to leave your IDE. Also, you can use future tooling as it becomes available.

## FAQ

FIRST, A NOTE ON BETA RELEASE 

Kindly note that the Affinidi Developer Tools such as Affinid VS Code Extension and Affindi CLI are in the open beta phase, and we are refining our product every day. The Affinidi Developer Tools may be incomplete and may contain errors – they may be unstable, and may cause a loss of functionality and data. Use of the Affinidi Developer Tools will be at your own risk. As our engineers seek to improve our platform, we would not have resources to provide any maintenance or tech support. Please bear with us as we continue to improve the platform. 

### What can I develop? 

You are only limited by your imagination! Affinidi Developer Tools is a toolbox with which you can build software applications for personal or commercial usage. 

### Is there anything I should not develop? 

What we provide are just tools. How you use them, is largely up to you. We have no control over what you develop with our tools - but please use our tools responsibly!  

We hope that you would not develop anything that contravenes any applicable laws or regulations. Your projects should also not infringe on Affinidi’s or any third party’s intellectual property (for instance, misusing other parties’ data, code, logos, etc). 

### What responsibilities do I have to my end-users? 

Please ensure that you have in place your own terms and conditions, privacy policies and other safeguards to ensure that the projects you build are secure for your end-users. 

If you are processing personal data, please protect the privacy and other legal rights of your end-users and store their personal or sensitive information securely. 

Some of our components would also require you to incorporate our end-user notices to your terms and conditions. 

### Are Affinidi Developer Tools free for use? 

Affinidi Developer Tools are free during the open beta phase, so come onboard and experiment with our tools and see what you can build! We may bill for certain components in the future, but we will inform you beforehand. 

### Is there any limit or cap to my usage of the Affinidi Developer Tools? 

We may from time to time impose limits on your use of the Affinidi Developer Tools, such as limiting the number of API requests that you may make in a given duration. This is to ensure smooth operation of the Affinidi Developer Tools so that you and all our other users can have a pleasant experience as we continue to scale and improve the Affinidi Developer Tools. 

### Do I need to provide you with anything? 

From time to time, we may request for certain information from you to ensure that you are complying with the [Terms of Use](https://build.affinidi.com/dev-tools/terms-of-use.pdf).

### Can I share my developer’s account with others? 

When you create a developer’s account with us, we will issue you your private log-in credentials. Please do not share this with anyone else, as you would be responsible for activities that happen under your account. If you have friends who are interested, ask them to sign up – let's build together!
